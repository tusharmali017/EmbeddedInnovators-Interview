5. Given a string, find character with maximum repetition. (Acceptable complexity is O(n) ) 
6. Given head pointer of singly linked list, find 4th last element of linked list. (Acceptable complexity is O(n) ) 
7. Given a head of sorted linked list of integers, write a routine to insert new element in linked list. 
8. Given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree and a value to be inserted into the tree. Insert this value into its appropriate position in the binary search tree and return the root of the updated binary tree.
