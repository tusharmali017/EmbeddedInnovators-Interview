1. what embedded systems experience do you have 
I have worked with PIC24 and PIC32 microcontrollers mainly in my current company where we used to implement different protocols like
Modbus using RS 485, CAN Protocol, diff slave devices interfaced with uc through SPI and I2C Protocol. I directly not worked on Ethernet(TCP/IP) but having knowledge of that things in the programming point of view.
 
2. Difference between Microcontroller and Microprocessor 
uc is a sysytem which is having inbuilt peripheral connected and up is not having inbuilt peripherals like uart, adc etc.
uc is based on Harvard architecture and up is based on von-neuman architecture.
 
3. Address bus / Data bus  
Address bus is used to send address from which data to be read or data to be write.
data bus is used to send data.

4. What is clock in controller ? Types of clocks in controller.  
Clock in the uc is used for sequential execution.
Types of clock/oscillator-
Crystals, ceramic resonators, RC (resistor, capacitor) oscillators, and silicon oscillators.

5. What is Embedded system  
6. Types of memory and difference between them  
7. Difference between OS and RTOS  
8. Basic protocols understanding, pins, difference, limitations and how they works : UART, SPI, I2C,
9. UART 
   9.1. UART protocol understanding. How data being transferred using UART. ?  
   9.2. what is baudrate? Difference between bitrate and baudrate? On which baudrate you have used UART ?
   9.3. What maximum baudrate supported for UART.
   9.4. Ever heard of USART. What is it ?
10. I2C 
   10.1. How to read/write data between I2C bus  
   10.2. Does it supports multi-master ? How ? 
11. SPI 
   11.1. Does it supports multi-master ? >A> NO: 
	11.1.1. why it is not supporting ? 
   11.2. How to xfer data between multiple slave/master using SPI  
   11.3. Is there any acknowledgement received for data that we sent using SPI ? Is there in I2C ? 
12. What is DMA ?  
13. What is interrupt ? How to use it ?  
14. What is ISR ?
    14.1. Is it okay to use sleep in ISR ?
    14.2. Can we pass parameters/return type in ISR ?		NO
    14.3. Can we use any function in ISR ?  
15. What happened when interrupt occurs ?  
16. Interrupt latency and turnover time  
17. Timers in Microcontroller. How to generate 1sec. of timer ?  
18. Watchdog timer. Use of it.  
19. What is IoT ?  
20. What is a segmentation fault ? What are the reasons of occurrence of the same ?  
21. Types of Endianness. Difference between them. How to check Endianness using C program. 
22. What is Flash memory ? NAND flash vs NOR flash difference.  
23. Difference bet Asynchronous and Synchronous communication
    >A>
    - No common clk in Async, In sync shared clk
    - Async send 1 byte at a time, sync sends data in form of blocks/frames 
    - Async slower compared to sync 
    - Async can communicate longer distance  
    - Async use start/stop bit for data sync 
    - Async: RS232, RS485   Sync: I2C, SPI
